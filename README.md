DATA SCIENCE SALARIES 


Due to the rise of Data Scientist job positions nowadays, I was wondering what has the most impact on Data Scientist salary.

I took the dataset from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries 


QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
1. Does remote work affect the salary in DS? 
2. Does the size of the company affect the salary in DS? 


You will find one cleaned dataset: df.csv and raw dataset: ds_salaries.csv

Additionaly I generated a decision tree graph : tree.png



Happy reading :)
