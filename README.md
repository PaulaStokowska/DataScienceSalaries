DATA SCIENCE SALARIES


Due to the rise of Data Scientist job positions nowadays, I was wondering what has the most impact on Data Scientist salary.

I took the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries

QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
1. Does remote work affect the salary in DS?
2. Does the size of the company affect the salary in DS?

You will find one cleaned dataset: df.csv and a raw dataset: ds_salaries.csv

HYPOTHESIS
1. Yes, the remote ratio has an influence on the salary
2. Biggest companies pays the highest salaries
3. People who does not work remotely or work 50/50 earn the highest salaries


FINAL RESULTS 

1. Yes, the remote ratio has an influence on the salary - TRUE

In all three company sizes majority of the people work remotely (08.2022) and they represent the highest average salary.
It is very hard to estimate HOW remote ratio influence salary but we can see a few patterns:


2. Biggest companies pays the highest salaries - FALSE

Most of the workers are employed by the medium size companies and in average earn the highest salaries.


3. People who does not work remotely or work 50/50 earn the highest salaries

, other variables come into place. Despite the price increase, the general
cost of living increasing as well, the number of avocados bought per habitant doesnâ€™t fluctuate significantly

West, California and South Central have consumed the most avocados from 2015 to 2021. Los Angeles is the city where the most avocados
were sold during that period (1.05 billion avocados sold). Los Angeles and New York consume the most avocados, followed by Dallas,
Houston, Phoenix, Chicago and San Francisco.

Quite the opposite, the PLU4770 is the least sold while the smaller one, the PLU 4046 is now the one sold the most. However it would be
important to compare the production units to the units sold to see if the fact that the PLU4770 being sold the least is because it is also the
least produced.

No, the trend in Los Angeles tends to be stabilized around 150 million every year while the general trend in the U.S tends to increase over the
years.
