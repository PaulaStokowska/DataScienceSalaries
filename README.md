DATA SCIENCE SALARIES


Due to the rise of Data Scientist job positions nowadays, I was wondering what has the most impact on Data Scientist salary.

I took the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries

QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
Does remote work affect the salary in DS?
Does the size of the company affect the salary in DS?

You will find one cleaned dataset: df.csv and a raw dataset: ds_salaries.csv

Additionally, I generated a few graphs to download.

Happy reading :)
