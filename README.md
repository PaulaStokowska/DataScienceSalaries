DATA SCIENCE SALARIES


Due to the rise of Data Scientist job positions nowadays, I was wondering what has the most impact on Data Scientist salary.

I took the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries

QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
1. Does remote work affect the salary in DS?
2. Does the size of the company affect the salary in DS?

You will find one cleaned dataset: df.csv and a raw dataset: ds_salaries.csv

HYPOTHESIS
1. Yes, the remote ratio has an influence on the salary
2. Biggest companies pays the highest salaries


FINAL RESULTS 

1. Yes, the remote ratio has an influence on the salary - TRUE
In all three company sizes majority of the people work remotely (08.2022) and they represent the highest average salary.
It is very hard to estimate HOW remote ratio influences the salary.


2. Biggest companies pays the highest salaries - FALSE
Most of the workers are employed by the medium size companies and in average earn the highest salaries.
